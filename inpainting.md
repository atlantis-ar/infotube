# Image inpainting
### _Early era_
Image inpainting has been a cornerstone process in the history of art, aiming to fill damaged, deteriorating or even missing pieces of an artowork, while trying to mimic the original content, and when it is not available, respect the style of the piece of art. 

### _Industrial_era_
With the advent of technology people enjoyed a more intermediate,accurate and faster way of depicting reality, the _photography_. Along with the rapid spread of _photography_ throughout the population, came an even greater need for restoring and even sometimes complete images, since it came with a lot of caveats (exposure, high noise and more), especially in the earlier days.
